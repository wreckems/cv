        <h1>Richard Spence</h1>
        <p><em>Software developer, software and system architect</em></p>
        <p>I am a professional software developer with a background in the
          telecommunications industry.
          At one end of the scale I have coded highly constrained real-time
          embedded systems, including bootstrap, device-drivers, simple
          real-time operating systems, protocol stacks and management
          applications.
          At the other end of the scale I have designed an entire
          telecommunications product platform including making inputs to
          mechanical and electronic hardware design.
          In between I have gained a lot of experience with software tools
          including custom compilers and code generators, usually in order
          assist and promote code quality and testability.
